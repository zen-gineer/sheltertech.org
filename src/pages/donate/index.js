          <p>
            On this #GivingTuesday, we ask that you reflect on how important
            internet access is in your daily life. As we’ve shifted to a
            socially-distanced reality dependent on WiFi, many of us have been
            able to conduct Zoom calls to talk to our loved ones and coworkers,
            purchase deliverable groceries and take-out, and stream our favorite
            shows and movies. People experiencing homelessness often do not have
            internet access, making it harder to do all of these things.
          </p>
          <p>
            At ShelterTech, we believe connectivity is a right, not a privilege,
            and through our ShelterConnect program, we have installed free WiFi
            at a number of San Francisco-based shelters to help bridge this
            digital divide. You can learn more about ShelterConnect by watching
            our video{" "}

            Last year, <em>you</em> and other supporters gave contributions
            which enabled ShelterTech to provide WiFi internet connectivity to
            hundreds of individuals experiencing homelessness and housing
            insecurity in San Francisco. With our partners, the City of San
            Francisco and Cisco, providing at no cost the broadband and network
            equipment, respectively, ShelterTech funded installation costs to
            costs to outfit two shelters, the{" "}

            and MSC-South, with WiFi that collectively serves 640 people on a
            daily basis.
