              The SF Service Guide is an online directory of human services in
              San Francisco that launched in November 2019 and currently serves
              1,500 unique monthly users. The directory&apos;s focus is on
              homelessness and housing services but also covers a variety of
              other services, from education and legal aid to senior services
              and re-entry programs. Our goal is to help anyone with access to a
              smartphone, tablet, or computer find the services they need.
            </p>
            <p>
              SF Service Guide is supported by a grant from the SF Mayor&apos;s
              Office of Housing and Community Development and verified for
              accuracy by our data partner, the Homeless Advocacy Project of the
              JDC.

              The ShelterConnect program works with partners to deliver a free,
              turn-key WiFi solution for shelters and transitional housing
              facilities. ShelterConnect is proud to provide over 4,000 people a
              year with daily internet access in over 20 local shelters and
              resource centers.
            </p>
            <p>
              We focus on identifying strategies to reduce the lifetime program
              cost for wiring a shelter. The three primary costs are:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Equipment and licensing</li>
              <li>Installation labor</li>
              <li>Ongoing ISP charges</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              In 2019 we established a partnership with the City of San
              Francisco Digital Equity team to deliver 1GB fiber/ISP capability
              to future ShelterConnect locations at no cost. Working with
              partners, ShelterConnect has implemented free WiFi solutions at
              over 20 locations including the Star Hotel, Mission Hotel,
              MSC-South, and ten locations managed by Larkin Street Youth
              Services.
