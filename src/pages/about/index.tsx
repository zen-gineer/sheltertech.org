          <h2>ShelterTech Vision Statement</h2>
          <p>
            Our vision is a vibrant community where everyone has equitable and
            effective access to a wide range of human services, regardless of
            their status, income, or circumstances.
          </p>
          <h2>ShelterTech Mission Statement</h2>
          <p>
            ShelterTech reduces barriers for those in need by connecting them
            with human services and opportunities empowering them to live
            happier, healthier lives.
          </p>
          <h2>ShelterTech Overview</h2>
          <p>
            ShelterTech is an award-winning non-profit solving the biggest
            technology challenges faced by people experiencing homelessness and
            are housing insecure in San Francisco. Our unique, volunteer-driven
            organization is committed to bridging the digital divide, inspired
            by the belief that digital equity and connectivity is a right, not a
            privilege.
          </p>
          <p>
            With over 9,000 people in San Francisco and over 28,000 in the Bay
            Area currently unsheltered and tens of thousands more at risk of
            eviction, the situation has never been more dire. The tech boom in
            San Francisco has created thousands of jobs and great wealth. It has
            also widened the digital divide and created an affordable housing
            crisis, making a bad situation even worse.
          </p>
          <p>

          <p>
            I became homeless when I was injured and lost my welding job working
            on the new Bay Bridge in San Francisco. I realized the longer I
            stayed in that condition, the harder it would become to escape it.
            Living on the streets, you spend most of your time just trying to
            survive. It’s hard to know where to start, what services you need,
            how to get training in a new field or search for jobs. I had a
            smartphone and could find WiFi, but there weren&apos;t any apps or
            websites to help me get off the streets. Now I want to give back and
            help people that become homeless. Darcel founded ShelterTech to help
            bridge this digital divide.
